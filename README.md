# I want to try out the FX, what do I do
Follow instructions in [here](howto/README.md).

# Now to the full README
## First of all
This is by no means supported or otherwise authorized by Zoom Corporation.

I do not post any materials that are made by Zoom Co, explicitly. I would rather not post something I am not sure about, thus some of materials are vague and expect that interested reader can arrive to same discoveries and conclusions given the tools I talk about.

If you (whoever you are, personal or corporate) see something that infringes on your property, let me know. I will work it out with you to my best speed possible, down to removal if that is only way to settle it.

## Will this break my device?
If it is not clear from LICENSE: all things you do based on what you read or find here are your responsibility. I do not post what did not work for me, but I cannot know what will work for you. Risks are not much higher, in my opinion, compared to flashing new version of official firmware.

That said, do not try this night before the gig. Just keep the unit in the board, and return when it is not so hot.

## On full .asm files, if that was not clear
Do not ask for “full source code” or “full assembly” for FX. That is not mine to publish or reproduce. Situation here is exactly the situation with RomHacks for cartridge games: I have the hardware -> I modify the original -> I post difference -> You apply it onto original you should legally have. This is why I chose IPS format, because I feel this is more RomHack that anything.

# Where do I start if I want to do something similar?
Glad you asked, visit [library](library/README.md) for text descriptions and useful links, and [DYI section](diy/README.md) for hands-on materials such as scripts and so on.
