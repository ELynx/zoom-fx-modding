# I want to support you with money

Why thank you! See expandable section for more.

<details>
  Please read some items below, and proceed if you want.
  
  First of all, I don't need your last money. These are, as usual, trying times, so make sure to take care of yourself before you tipping a stranger. I do this for myself and my fun, and hope for community to catch my ideas up. Use and have fun.
    
  Second, "tipping" does not mean "hiring". I don't take commissions, don't teach or promise to deliver X if I get Y. Have questions - ask them, I will answer them for free if I can. Have suggestions? Fire away. Want to discuss something? Sure. Money will not be a factor here.
  
  With that in mind:
  
  Use Gitlab Sponsors! It should allow _you_ to pay internationally, and _me_ to both receive moneys and pay all due taxes.

# Now to the software development and official README
## First of all
This is by no means supported or otherwise authorized by Zoom Corporation.

I do not post any materials that are made by Zoom Co, explicitly. I would rather not post something I am not sure about, thus some of materials are vague and expect that interested reader can arrive to same discoveries and conclusions given the tools I talk about.

You may see Zoom Co related imagery in media files I use for demonstration. All images, fonts and names are property and trademark of Zoom Co and I do my best to use them fairly.

YouTube logo is embedded by the link to official web site. This project has no relation or affiliation with YouTube, I only use their logo as signifier of where link directs to.

VK logo is embedded by the link to official web site. This project has no relation or affiliation with VK, I only use their logo as signifier of where link directs to.

Telegram logo used in this README is downloaded from official press / media kit. This project has no relation or affiliation with Telegram, I only use their logo as signifier of where link directs to.

–ÆMoney logo used in this README is downloaded from official press / media kit. This project has no relation or affiliation with –ÆMoney, I only use them as tips provider.

If you (whoever you are, personal or corporate) see something that infringes on your property, let me know. I will work it out with you to my best speed possible, down to removal if that is only way to settle it.

## Will this break my device?
If it is not clear from LICENSE: all things you do based on what you read or find here are your responsibility. I do not post what did not work for me, but I cannot know what will work for you. Risks are not much higher, in my opinion, compared to flashing new version of official firmware.

That said, do not try this night before the gig. Just keep the unit in the board, and return when it is not so hot.

## On full .asm files, if that was not clear
Do not ask for ‚Äúfull source code‚Äù or ‚Äúfull assembly‚Äù for FX. That is not mine to publish or reproduce. Situation here is exactly the situation with RomHacks for cartridge games: I have the hardware -> I modify the original -> I post difference -> You apply it onto original you should legally have. This is why I chose IPS format, because I feel this is more RomHack that anything.

## Where do I start if I want to do something similar?
Glad you asked, visit [library](library/README.md) for text descriptions and useful links, and [DYI section](diy/README.md) for hands-on materials such as scripts and so on.

## Dibs
I call dibs on sorting index `0xF1` (decimal `241`) across all effect types. I will use sub-indexes if I have more than one effect in category.
